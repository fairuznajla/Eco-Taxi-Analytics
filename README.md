# Deck Recommendation and Monitoring Dashboard for Eco-Friendly Online Taxi Company

### This team project is the implementation of an Independent Study program at GreatEdu x MSIB Kampus Merdeka Batch 5 that focuses on Data Analytics. We created a recommendation deck and monitoring dashboard for an eco-friendly online taxi company using K-Means and Hierarchical clustering of CO2 emissions from various car brands. 

### From the results of this analysis, the company gets the best car brand cluster recommendations that produce low emission gases so that it can make business decisions easier. By only operating low emission cars, the company also participates in minimising air pollution and supports the sustainability of SDG's point 13 "Climate Action".
