# Recommendation Deck and Monitoring Dashboard for Eco-Friendly Online Taxi Company

### This team project is the implementation of an Independent Study program at GreatEdu x MSIB Kampus Merdeka Batch 5 that focuses on Data Analytics. We used K-Means and Hierarchical clustering analysis to cluster car brands based on their CO2 emission levels. The results of this analysis provided the company with recommendations for the best cluster of low emission car brands, allowing the company to determine which car brands can be operated by drivers. By operating only low-emission cars, the company also participates in minimising air pollution and supports the sustainability of SDG point 13 'Climate Action'. We delivered insights into the business needs of Eco-Friendly Online Taxi Company in recommendation deck and monitoring dashboards.
